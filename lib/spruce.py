'''
In this file you'll find some useful variables
and functions you may need elsewhere.

To use these just import this file like this:

                import lib.spruce as spruce

Then you can call any function like this:

                spruce.any_function()

Or get global variable like this:

                spruce.app              # returns name (str) of current app
                spruce.device           # returns name of current device
'''

app = "sd" # Stores the name of the app we're currently on
device = "a30" # Stores the name of the currently selected device
terminal = None # Stores a terminal. TODO: make it a vector
window_geometry = None # Stores window information

#importing things we need to make these functions work
